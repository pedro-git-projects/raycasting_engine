# JavaScript Raycasting Engine 

# The objective 

Ray casting is a rendering technique that is capable of creating a three-dimensional perspective in a two-dimensional map. In this project the aim was to create a raycasting engine for rendering pseudo 3D graphics using trigonometric functions (another common techinque is the use of vectors) so as to deepen my understanding of computer graphics, mathematics and JavaScript.

# Technology 

The technologies used were CSS, to draw the canvas, the boarders and center the content, the p5js library, in order to simplify drawing on the screen, and vanilla JavaScript, to implement the actual graphical engine. You can check out p5js at https://p5js.org/ 


# Running the code

As JavaScript is an interpreted language, one needs to simply clone this repo and open the html file in the browser.
